Updated the latest matlab:

Limiting search from icaphoton now works (can still see all epochs in
epochs, but when you search in epochs it will only choose epochs from
what you have set in icaphoton).

Added ganglion cell to list of cell choices.

Can now easily return to the default axis after changing axis to get a
close up view (playtime).

Updates in the usual place.  To get these changes you only need to copy
over epochs.m and playtime.m.
