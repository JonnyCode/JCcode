move PPC converter.  There are two of these, one does a single file at a 
time, the other will do a list of files in the current directory.  These 
live in Users/lab/Public/Local/Programming/Acq_osx_convert/.  


PPC converter instructions: 

For either of these to work the converter must be in the same directory as
the file(s) you wish to convert.  For the single file converter, give a
different name as the output file, or you will overwrite your original
data file.  Double-click on the application to start it. 

To do multiple files, you must first make a file with a list of the names
of the files you wish to convert.  The easiest way to do this is by using
the terminal.  Go to the directory that has the data files in it (cd
~/Data).  ls > names.file on the command line will make a file called
names.file that has each filename on a separate line.  If there are files
in the directory that you do not want to convert, you can open the file up
with pico (pico names.file), and you can delete any lines you don't want. 
(^X to exit, will give you the opportunity to save).  Once you have this
file, just start the application by double-clicking and tell it the name
of the file.  It will go through the files one by one.  If it runs into a
file it cannot convert, it will quit mid-list, and you will have to re-do
the rest of the files.
